# Task-6-Password
cybersecurity internship task(6)- Password

## Objective:
To understand what makes a password strong and evaluate various passwords using online tools.

## Tested Passwords:
| Password                     | Score      | Crack Time         | Tool Used               | Feedback |
| U!no@4Mine56                 | ~98-100%   | ~centuries         | passwordmonster.com     | Very strong; good symbol use and obfuscation. Slight risk due to recognizable words like "uno" and "mine"         |
| #ice/Hot2812fTRe/cream#      | ~100%      | ~Trillion Years    | passwordmonster.com     | Extremely strong and long; well-obfuscated. Slight word presence but fully masked by structure                    |
| ?#CybeR$Ecurity8083!         | ~96-99%    | ~Billion years     | passwordmonster.com     | Excellent mix of characters; recognizable word "CyberSecurity" is well hidden with symbols and case               |
| !Am@zoN#256&SinGh@           | ~96-99%    | ~Billion years     | passwordmonster.com     | Very strong, but contains personal/named entities ("Amazon", "Singh"); good obfuscation compensates               |
| $H@rsH!626@                  | ~88-92%    | ~Months To Years   | passwordmonster.com     | Strong but includes full name ("Harsh") — vulnerable if attacker knows your identity; short for high-value use    |

## Tips Learned:
- Use long, complex passwords.
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers.
- Avoid using real names or simple sequences.
  

## Common Attacks:
 - 2 type:
    -Simple brute force attacks
    -Dictionary attacks
   
*Brute Force:*
 - There are various types of brute force attack methods that allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and steal user data.
     - Hybrid brute force attacks:
              A hybrid brute force attack is when a hacker combines a dictionary attack method with a simple brute force attack
     - Reverse brute force attacks:
              A reverse brute force attack sees an attacker begin the process with a known password, which is typically discovered through a network breach.

*Dictionary Attack:* 
 -In its simplest form, a dictionary attack is a type of brute force attack where hackers try to guess a user’s password to their online accounts by quickly running through a list of commonly used words, phrases,    and number combinations

 
## Best Practices:
- Use long passwords
- Mix Character Type
- Avoid Personal Information
- Use Passphrases
- Enable multi-factor authentication.
- Change Password Regularly
- Test Password Strength
